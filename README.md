# About My Project
GO FAST niche Website  is developed using REACT JS, Bootstrap and Mongodb database which can show shoe products with images and details, provide login and signup features and lastly help customers to add and check out products from their cart. The site also uses Bootstrap which has provided the site with a beautiful and interactive user interface.

I am using Reactjs for the front-end and Mongodb/heroku for the back-end. The styling part will be done using CSS and BootStrap while the functionality will be added using JavaScript. We plan on making it as user-friendly as possible, with preplanned packages and even custom packages available which user can choose according to his preference.

About the system
The home page features products in a three grid layout along with their images, title, and price. Clicking the product, the customer will be taken into the item description page and the customer can add them in their cart along with the quantity needed. Once added, the customer can see all products in their cart and can proceed to checkout. However, if they are not logged in the user needs to log in or register themselves on the site. For registration, the user needs to submit their name, username, email, and address. Besides the functionality, the site also features a contact page, about and privacy page.
